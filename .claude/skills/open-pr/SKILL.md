Create a draft PR for the current branch with an AngriestBird-style summary, linked GitHub issues, and changelog entries for any changes not yet listed in `Changelog.txt`.

Arguments (optional, space-separated):

- Issue numbers to close, e.g. `1354 1261`
- A quoted PR title override, e.g. `"Fix Cuba AI and Egypt bugs"`

Requested arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

### 1. Read branch state

```
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat
git diff origin/main...HEAD
```

If the branch has no commits ahead of `main`, stop: "No commits ahead of main, nothing to open a PR for."

### 2. Parse arguments

From `$ARGUMENTS`:

- Bare integers are issue numbers to close.
- Any double-quoted string is the PR title override.

If no issue numbers were given: scan the step-1 commit messages for `#N` patterns and collect them as candidates. Do NOT fail; continue without `Closes #N` lines. At the end, tell the user which issue numbers you found in commits and prompt them to re-run as `/open-pr N M` to link them.

### 3. Fetch linked issues

For each issue number from step 2, run:

```
gh issue view <N> --repo MillenniumDawn/Millennium-Dawn --json number,title,body,labels
```

Use the title and body to write an accurate root-cause sentence in the summary. If `gh` errors (not found or private), note the failure and skip that number.

### 4. Derive the PR title

If the user supplied a quoted title, use it verbatim.

Otherwise: strip a `fix/`, `feature/`, `chore/`, or `content/` prefix from the branch name, replace hyphens and underscores with spaces, title-case each word, then append `(#N, #M)` if issue numbers were given.

Examples:

- Branch `fix/cuba-egypt-bugs` + issues 1354, 1261 → `"Fix Cuba Egypt Bugs (#1354, #1261)"`
- Branch `thegeneral-uk` (no prefix): prefer the most descriptive commit subject line as the title.

For a personal fork branch with no clear description (e.g. `thegeneral-uk`), derive the title from the most descriptive commit subject in the log. Keep it under 70 characters.

### 5. Compose the PR body

Use this exact structure (AngriestBird format):

```
Closes #N
Closes #M

### Summary

#### Bug Fixes

- **Fixes #N: [Issue Title].** [Root cause in 1-2 sentences, specific: name focus ID, event ID, wrong value vs. correct value, using `backtick` for code identifiers.]

#### [Other grouping, e.g. "AI", "Content", "Localisation", "Validation"]

- **[Component or focus/event ID].** [What was added or changed and why.]

### Test plan

**Playthrough A: <TAG> <year> (covers #N, #M)**

<phase header, e.g. "Game start, before unpausing:">

- [ ] `tag <TAG>`, <action>, confirm <expected outcome> (#N).
- [ ] <next checkbox> (#M).

<next phase header, e.g. "Mid-game checks (advance several in-game weeks first):">

- [ ] <action>, confirm <expected outcome> (#N).

**Playthrough B: <TAG> <year> (covers #X)**

- [ ] <action>, confirm <expected outcome> (#X).
```

Rules:

- Include `Closes #N` lines only when issue numbers were given. Place them above `### Summary` with one blank line between the last close and `### Summary`.
- `#### Bug Fixes`: one bullet per distinct fix. Group micro-changes (e.g. "Fixed 12 log copy-paste errors") into a single bullet.
- Other subsections (`#### AI`, `#### Content`, etc.): include only if there are non-bug changes in that category.
- **Never use em dashes (`—`, U+2014) anywhere: not in the PR title, body, bullet separators, Changelog.txt, or any `.yml` file.** Replace with a colon (introducing the explanation), a period (ending the bolded prefix, new sentence), or a comma (continuing the clause). Standing user rule, no exceptions even when mimicking AngriestBird's example PRs.
- Bullet structure: bold the issue ref and title together followed by a period (`**Fixes #N: Issue Title.**`), a space, then the description. No `—` separator.
- Bullet length: **2 sentences, 2-3 lines max** per fix (one for cause, one for resolution). Name the key focus/event/decision ID and the wrong-vs-right value; skip commit hashes, file:line citations, repro chains, and regression notes (those go in the commit and issue). The `Closes #N` lines are always preserved.
- Test plan: one or more **playthroughs**, like PR #1525. Each block starts with a bold header naming the country tag, start year, and issues it covers, e.g. `**Playthrough A: ENG 2000 (covers #1400, #1515, #1516)**`. Group checks under phase sub-headers when the test needs setup beyond game start (e.g. `Game start, before unpausing:` vs `Mid-game checks (advance several in-game weeks first):`).
- Every check is a markdown task list item: start with `- [ ]`, never bare `- `. One checkbox per distinct in-game action. End each with the issue ref it covers, `(#N)`.
- Checkbox structure: console command (if any) in backticks, then the action, then `confirm <expected outcome>`. Separate clauses with commas or periods, not `→` or `—`. Example: ``- [ ] `tag UKR`, hover an internal faction the country does not have, confirm the preview tooltip opens with the shared header (#1516).``
- Single-issue PRs may use one playthrough block. Skip phase sub-headers if every check happens at game start. The `- [ ]` rule still applies.

### 6. Check and update `Changelog.txt`

a. Read `Changelog.txt`. Identify the top-most version heading (e.g. `v2.0.0`) and collect all existing category headings (lines matching `^ [A-Za-z].*:$`). Valid categories are whatever is already in the file; do **not** invent new ones.

b. For each distinct change in the diff, check whether a matching entry already exists by searching for the focus/event/decision ID or issue number (`Issue #N`):

```
grep -n "focus_id_or_issue" Changelog.txt
```

c. For changes **not yet listed**: write entries and insert under the correct existing category in the top-most version section. Format:

```
 Category:
  - [TAG] Past-tense verb. Specific object name. (Issue #N)
```

- 1 space before the category name; 2 spaces + `- ` before each entry.
- `[TAG]` prefix for country-specific changes; no prefix for global changes.
- Past tense, specific, no em dashes anywhere (use `:`, `.`, or `,`).
- If a change fits no existing category, use the closest match (localisation fix under ` Localization:`, script fix under ` Bugfix:`).

d. If changes were added, stage and commit them separately **before** creating the PR:

```
git add Changelog.txt
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Update Changelog.txt

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

If `Changelog.txt` is already up to date, skip this step and note "Changelog already up to date."

### 7. Push and create the draft PR

Push the branch if not already on the remote:

```
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Then create the draft PR:

```
gh pr create --draft \
  --repo MillenniumDawn/Millennium-Dawn \
  --title "<title from step 4>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<body from step 5>
EOF
)"
```

### 8. Report back

Output:

1. The PR URL.
2. Whether `Changelog.txt` was updated and which entries were added, or "Changelog already up to date."
3. If **no** issue numbers were provided: list any `#N` references found in commits and tell the user: "To link these issues, re-run as `/open-pr N M`."
