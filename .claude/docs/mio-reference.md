# MIO Reference

On-demand reference for Military-Industrial Organization structure, examples, and valid modifier keys. For best practices, see AGENTS.md.

## Example MIO

```
CHI_norinco_manufacturer = {
	allowed = { original_tag = CHI }
	icon = GFX_idea_Norinco_CHI

	task_capacity = 18

	equipment_type = {
		infantry_weapons_type
		artillery_equipment
		mio_cat_all_armor
	}

	research_categories = {
		CAT_infrastructure
		CAT_armor
		CAT_artillery
	}

	initial_trait = {
		name = CHI_norinco_trait
		equipment_bonus = {
			reliability = 0.03
			build_cost_ic = -0.03
		}
	}
}
```

## Key Points

- Name MIOs `TAG_organization_name`
- Always include `allowed = { original_tag = TAG }` to restrict to the correct country
- `task_capacity` scales with the org's breadth and nation size, not a formula. Most MIOs omit it — 5 is the MD default (`DEFAULT_INITIAL_TASK_CAPACITY`). When set: 2-3 for small/niche orgs, ~10 for major-nation manufacturers (USA/SOV/FRA/ENG), 18-25 for sprawling multi-category giants (CHI Norinco covers 8 equipment types at 18)
- Equipment types must reference valid `equipment_type` categories
- Trait grid x is bounded `0..9`; y is unlimited. Use `relative_position_id` for branch internals but keep total x-spread inside 0..9
- An **organic network is the default**: branches interleave and cross-link, paths split and reconverge, and cross-branch parents are encouraged (a parent from another branch is fine as long as it sits at a lower `y` than the child). Produce a clean raster/column layout only when explicitly requested.
- A child sits below its parent; vertical spacing may vary for an organic layout, but a child is never on or above its parent's row
- Mutually exclusive traits sit on the same row (same `y` value), placed side by side
- A parent's connecting line must reach its child without crossing sibling traits on the same row. If it would cross, reposition the child or nudge with `relative_position_id`.
- Children that should inherit from either of two mutually exclusive parents must use `any_parent` (not `parent`) — otherwise picking the "wrong" parent locks the child out
- Spread `organization_modifier` / `production_bonus` traits across tree depth (near roots, mid-tree, and leaves) rather than clustering them in the bottom rows. Full organic-layout playbook lives in the `mio-builder` skill.
- Name the initial trait `{org_token}_trait` (e.g. `CHI_norinco_trait`)
- `on_complete` always needs `on_complete = { expenditure_for_mio_upgrade = yes }`, unless you add custom effects (idea switch, give a factory, etc.)
- Localisation goes in the country-specific loc file (`localisation/english/MD_focus_TAG`)

| `military_industrial_organization_research_bonus`                      | Flat increase to the research bonus percentage the MIO applies. If it gave 20% and receives "0.1" here, it then gives 30%.       | `military_industrial_organization_research_bonus = 0.1`                       |
| `military_industrial_organization_size_up_requirement`                 | Modifies funds needed to level up, accelerating trait unlocks. Use when designing an MIO with an above-average number of traits. | `military_industrial_organization_size_up_requirement = -0.1`                 |
| `military_industrial_organization_task_capacity`                       | Flat increase to the number of tasks an MIO can be assigned in parallel.                                                         | `military_industrial_organization_task_capacity = 5`                          |
