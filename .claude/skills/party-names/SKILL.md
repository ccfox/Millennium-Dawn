---

Fill in a country's political parties across all 24 subideology slots: the localisation
keys, the descriptions, and the scripted-localisation hooks that make them render.

Requested arguments: $ARGUMENTS (a 3-letter TAG; ask if none given).

Read `.claude/docs/party-loc-reference.md` first — it holds the slot table, the key format,
the icon rules, the hook mechanics, and the verification checklist. This skill is the
procedure; that doc is the reference.

## Steps

1. **Inventory what exists**

   ```bash
   grep -n "^ TAG\." localisation/english/MD_politics_view_parties_l_english.yml
   grep -n "localization_key = TAG\." common/scripted_localisation/00_MD_politicsview_scripted_localisation.txt
   grep -n 'name = "GFX_TAG_' interface/MD_parties_icons.gfx
   grep -n "party_pop_array" "history/countries/TAG - *.txt"
   ```

   Report which of the 24 slots are filled, which names are still bare `£ICON Name` rather
   than the `£ICON (ABBRV) - Name` standard, which `_desc` values are empty, and — the one
   that bites — which existing keys have **no hook** and are therefore already dead.

2. **Research the parties**

   Research the country's real political parties for 2000–2025 and map them to slots. For
   each: official native name and transliteration, abbreviation, founding year (and
   dissolution if defunct), founder or defining leader, precise ideology, and two or three
   concrete facts — best electoral result, splits, coalitions, EP group.

   Leave a slot generic when the country has no real counterpart. Do not invent parties.
   Non-party entities are allowed only where the reference doc says so.

   Where a country's party of a given slot changed identity mid-period (a ban, a rename, a
   successor), plan a date- or flag-gated variant pair instead of picking one.

3. **Confirm the mapping before writing.**

   Present the slot→party table and the slots you intend to leave generic. This is where
   judgement calls get settled; do not write 50 keys on an unconfirmed mapping.

4. **Check the sprites**

   For each mapped party decide tag sprite vs generic, per the reference doc's icon rules.
   Verify each `£name` resolves in `interface/` before writing it.

5. **Write the loc block**

   Replace or extend the tag's contiguous block in
   `localisation/english/MD_politics_view_parties_l_english.yml`, keeping it in tag-alphabetical
   position and ordering keys by `^N` index. Leading space on every line; the file keeps its
   UTF-8 BOM.

6. **Wire the hooks**

   Add a line to `<slot>_L` and `<slot>_L_desc` for every filled slot, and to `<slot>_L_icon`
   only where a tag sprite exists, in
   `common/scripted_localisation/00_MD_politicsview_scripted_localisation.txt`. Insert
   alphabetically by tag. Gated variants go in adjacent pairs, most specific first, and a
   date-split name needs its icon hook split to match.

7. **Verify**

   Run `python tools/validation/validate_party_loc.py --tag <TAG>` until it is clean, then
   work the rest of the reference doc's verification checklist. Finally, in game, open the
   politics view at the start date and at any date the gates split on.
